## Brace Expansion

Brace expansion is a powerful Bash feature for generating arbitrary strings. It helps create sequences or lists efficiently.

**Examples:**

```bash
echo file_{a,b,c}.txt
# Output: file_a.txt file_b.txt file_c.txt

echo {1..5}
# Output: 1 2 3 4 5

mkdir dir_{01..03}
# Creates directories: dir_01, dir_02, dir_03
```

**Use Case:**  
Automate repetitive tasks, like creating multiple files or directories.

## Parameter Expansion

Parameter expansion lets you manipulate variable values and set defaults.

**Examples:**

```bash
name="Alice"
echo ${name:-"Unknown"}
# Output: Alice

unset name
echo ${name:-"Unknown"}
# Output: Unknown

greeting="Hello World"
echo ${#greeting}
# Output: 11 (length of the string)

filename="report.txt"
echo ${filename%%.*}
# Output: report (removes everything after the first dot)
```

**Use Case:**  
Set default values, get string lengths, or extract parts of variables.

---

## String Manipulation & Substring Operations

Bash provides tools for extracting and modifying strings.

**Examples:**

```bash
text="abcdef"
echo ${text:2:3}
# Output: cde (substring from index 2, length 3)

file="archive.tar.gz"
echo ${file%.gz}
# Output: archive.tar (removes .gz from end)

echo ${file#*.}
# Output: tar.gz (removes up to first dot)
```

**Use Case:**  
Extract file extensions, get substrings, or remove prefixes/suffixes.

## Arithmetic & Floating-Point (with `bc`)

Bash supports integer arithmetic natively, but for floating-point, use `bc`.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Integer arithmetic
a=5
b=3
echo $((a + b))
# Output: 8

# Floating-point arithmetic
x=5.5
y=2.3
result=$(echo "$x + $y" | bc)
echo $result
# Output: 7.8
```

**Use Case:**  
Perform calculations in scripts, especially when dealing with decimals.

---

## Associative Arrays

Associative arrays allow you to use strings as keys (like dictionaries in Python).

**Examples:**

```bash
declare -A capitals
capitals[France]="Paris"
capitals[Germany]="Berlin"
capitals[Japan]="Tokyo"

echo ${capitals[Germany]}
# Output: Berlin

# Loop through keys
for country in "${!capitals[@]}"; do
    echo "$country: ${capitals[$country]}"
done
```

**Use Case:**  
Store and retrieve related data, such as configuration settings or mappings.

These advanced Bash features make scripts more powerful, efficient, and easier to maintain. Practice each with real tasks to master their usage.
